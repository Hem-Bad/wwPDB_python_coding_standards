# Converting Python2 code to Python3

## Updating existing code

The python developers have provided a tool for converting Python 2 code to Python 3
called 2to3.

There are two ways to use it, and which one you use depends on your module:

* For simple modules (or well tested modules), you can just apply
 all the fixers at once and then fix any issues that arise: `2to3 -w example.py`
* For more complex projects, you may wish to only apply one fixer at a time, 
test that the changes didn't break anything, and then continue applying fixers.

You can see details on all the fixers [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html)

A more thorough guide on conversion is located [here](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html)

## Writing python2/python3 polyglots

For most code it is fairly straightforward to update it to run in both Python 2
and Python 3 interpreters. This usually only gets more challenging when your code
encodes or decodes text between unicode and ASCII.

The two most common issues you will need to address:

* Always use the print function rather than print statement. Then simply add the
`from __future__ import print_function` import to the top of your project to enable
the print function calls to work in Python 2.
* Some modules have moved locations slightly in Python 3. To let your code work in either
 version, use the following pattern:
```python
# urlquote moved from Python 2 to Python 3
try:
    from urllib import quote as urlquote
except ImportError:
    from urllib.parse import quote as urlquote
```
